This script is not the one on $BRANCH.

  running: $SELF
  repo:    $APP_DIR/deploy/provision.sh

Refusing to rewrite the systemd unit from it. An out-of-date copy will replace a
working unit with an older one and restart into it without complaining.

The checkout is now current, so run the version that came with it:

    cp $APP_DIR/deploy/provision.sh /tmp/prov-current.sh
    sudo bash /tmp/prov-current.sh

Copied out to /tmp rather than run in place, because updating the checkout
rewrites this file, and bash reads a script by byte offset as it executes.

If the difference is deliberate — a local edit you are testing — re-run with
SKIP_SELF_CHECK=1.
