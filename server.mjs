     Measured over a window rather than per input, because per input is not a

     30 rad/s was the first guess at "far above what a fast player peaks at",

  /* The round is part of the handshake, not just of `start`. A player who

     `started` is the same idea one step further: it tells a peer arriving
     mid-round to walk into the match rather than wait in a lobby for a start
     that already happened. The relay sends no world state with it — the host
     seats the arrival on the next roster broadcast and the existing snapshot
