   ACTION ZONE — sign-in, the locker, and what you have equipped

   Two rules run through everything below.

   The first: nobody has to sign in. Signing in buys you skins and nothing
   else, so every failure here — a relay that has not shipped these
   endpoints, a dead network, a browser with localStorage switched off —
   ends in the same place, which is the title screen exactly as it looks
   for a signed-out player. Nothing in this file may throw its way into
   the game.

   The second: the token is a cache and the server is the record. What a
   player owns is asked for on every load and never read out of
   localStorage, because localStorage is a text field the player can edit.
   Which skin they have *chosen* to wear is the opposite — it is a
   setting, it lives in localStorage, and losing it costs a preference
   rather than an item.
   ===================================================================== */

   since the slot is the first half of the id. The tints are decoration:
   deliberately a flat pastel swatch and not a render of the real skin, so a

   THE CALLBACK

   The relay finishes sign-in by sending the browser back to this page with
   `#auth_token=<token>&auth_expires_at=<ms>` on the end of the URL. Those
   two keys are the contract; nothing else is accepted, and in particular
   nothing is read out of the query string, because a fragment never
   leaves the browser and a query string is sent to every server the URL
   is aimed at.

   The fragment is erased from the address bar before anything else in the
   page can read location.href. In the assembled page all of it — the
   erasure and the handoff to the opener both — has already happened by the
   time this file is parsed: the inline snippet at the top of <head> does
   the whole job in the first tick and keeps the token inside its own
   closure, because everything between there and here, the CDN copy of
   Three.js included, runs with page privileges and could read anything
   left on window. The parsing below is the fallback for a page assembled
   without that snippet, and it is what the tests drive; in the built page
   it finds an empty fragment and does nothing. Either way the token leaves
   the URL, because a token left
   in the bar survives into browser history, into a bookmark, into anything
   the player copies; COPY INVITE builds its link out of location.href, so
   a token still sitting there would be pasted into a chat window along
   with the invite. It is erased even when it is malformed, and even when
   it is refused outright below, because a token we will not use is still a
   token somebody else should not be able to read.

   A CALLBACK IS ONLY WORTH ANYTHING IF WE ASKED FOR IT

   A bearer token on the end of a URL is a URL that signs you in, and a URL
   is something anybody can send anybody. Left unguarded, a link to
   `…/#auth_token=<a token of mine>` signs the person who clicks it into
   *my* account — /auth/me agrees, the panel shows my name, and every skin
   they buy from then on is bought for me. Nothing about the token itself
   can tell the two cases apart: it is perfectly valid, it is just not
   theirs.

   So the evidence has to come from this browser instead. Pressing SIGN IN
   writes a random nonce into sessionStorage and only then opens the popup,
   which inherits a copy of that storage; the callback lands in the popup,
   which is the only window that ever visits the relay. A load carrying a
   callback is therefore believed only when it has both an opener and a
   live marker — that is, only when it is a window this page opened for a
   sign-in somebody actually asked for. Anything else is somebody else's
   link, and the token goes in the bin (the URL has already been scrubbed
   above, which is the part that matters even for a token we refuse).

   The nonce then travels back with the token in the postMessage, where the
   opener checks it against the attempt it is still waiting on.

   ?server= is deliberately not consulted here, and this is the one place
   this file knowingly parts company with 75-network.js. That override
   exists so a player can point the *gameplay socket* at a LAN box or a
   relay of their own, and it is typed into a URL somebody else can send
   them. Letting it choose where credentials go would turn a shareable
   link into a way to collect bearer tokens: one visit to
   ?server=https://somewhere-else and this page would introduce itself,
   token first, to whoever was listening. Where the game connects and
   where the session lives are two different questions, so they get two
   different answers. A private origin is still allowed to serve its own

/* =====================================================================
   THE DISPLAY CASE

   A skin is a picture, and a shop that describes pictures in words is not
   a shop. So the panel builds the real thing: buildCharacter and
   buildGunMesh, the same two functions the match calls, so what turns in
   the case is the model that will be on the street — not an illustration
   of it that can drift.

   Three rules run through everything below, and each of them is here
   because of a specific way this can go wrong.

   ONE CONTEXT. There is exactly one WebGLRenderer for the whole store,
   and it is not made until the panel is opened for the first time. A
   browser gives a page a small number of live WebGL contexts and then
   starts taking the oldest ones away; the game is already holding one,
   and six more — a canvas per card — is how a store costs a player the
   match they were about to play.

   THE GAME'S OWN LIGHT. The numbers below are copied from initLights and
   initViewmodel and are not to be tuned by eye. The materials are
   MeshToonMaterial over a four-step gradient map, and there is no tone
   mapping in r128: past roughly 1.35 of total intensity the top band
   clips, and a wall of pastels all clip to the same white. A preview lit
   "so you can see it better" is how this store once ended up advertising
   six colourless skins. Characters get the world rig because that is
   where a character is seen; guns get the viewmodel rig, because a gun is
   seen in your own hands.

   NOTHING HERE MAY BREAK THE PANEL. Every entry point checks its
   elements, its builders and its THREE, every build is wrapped, and a
   context that cannot be made or is later lost hides the case and leaves
   the cards below exactly as they were before any of this existed.

   SEASON 1 BATTLE PASS

   The screen the locker row's SEASON 1 button opens. It is the store's
   pattern a second time — a .screen dialog, opened from the title card,
   closed by CLOSE, by Escape and by the wash — drawn from two inputs:

   The server's: GET /battlepass/me answers with the player's xp, tier,
   premium flag and claimed rewards. It is asked through storeAPI, a 401
   is the ordinary signed-out answer, and any other failure leaves the
   ladder standing read-only instead of breaking the screen.

   The mirror's: the 25-tier ladder below is copied from the server's
   season1.mjs because the client is not sent it. The mirror is only
   shape — which rewards sit at which tier — so state (what is reached,
   what is claimed, whether the pass is owned) is never read out of it.
   Reward ids resolve to the engine's existing cosmetic renderers; pass state
   remains keyed by tier and lane, and an unrecognised id still draws a card.
