   ROTATION, AND THE PICK THAT OUTRANKS IT
   The default is a rotation: a match ends and the next map in the pool
   loads, so both maps actually get played without anyone deciding. A
   player who does want to decide pins one from the MAP card, and a pin
   wins — a setting that quietly moved after every match would not be a
   setting. ROTATE is one of the picker's choices rather than a separate
   switch, so releasing the pin is the same gesture as making it.

   The swap is DEFERRED rather than done in endMatch, because endMatch
   leaves you standing in the map reading the scoreboard — rebuilding the
   world underneath that is the one moment it must not happen. The flag is
   spent by whichever comes first: returning to the title (so the card
   shows what is next) or pressing REMATCH straight from the over screen.

   The pin is session state, like the match mode: neither is persisted, so
   a reload starts both of them fresh.
