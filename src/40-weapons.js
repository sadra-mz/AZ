/* Weapon cosmetics live beside the simulation records but never replace
   them. A skin owns the whole *look* of the viewmodel — palette, effect
   colours and geometry — and none of its behaviour, so it can make a gun
   feel like a different toy without quietly introducing a fourth weapon
   with different damage, timing or ammunition.

   Three of the fields below are geometry rather than colour:

     build(B, P)  draws the gun's boxes instead of the default silhouette
     hands        where the mitten hands grab the new shape
     muzzle       [x, y, z] where the flash leaves the new barrel

   They are deliberately NOT in weaponForSkin's copy list. Everything the
   simulation ever reads goes through that function, and it still copies
   only col/flash/tracer; these three are read by buildGunMesh alone, which
   runs in vmScene after a depth clear and touches no hitbox, no spread and
   no timing. A skin can therefore reshape the gun without being able to
   reach a gameplay value even by accident.

   Colours are 24-bit 0xRRGGBB — six digits, never eight. The palette is the
   town's own — deepened, not replaced: blush paper and gold leaf, cobalt
   glaze, berry glass, aqua ribbon, caramel rattan. Every skin keeps a wide
   value range (a bright metal against a dark grip), stays clear of the
   mitten tones (0xffe0c8 / 0xfff8f0) so the gun separates from the hands
   holding it, and stays clear of near-black, which belongs to a harsher
   game than this one. skins.test.js enforces all of it.

   Each skin is a different KIND of object rather than a repainted gun, and
   the class silhouette is what survives the change: magazine-forward and
   stubby for the SMG, wide-fronted and heavy for the shotgun, long and lean
   under a raised sight line for the rifle.

   What makes them a different kind of object rather than the same outline
   with more blocks bolted on is that none of them is built from axis-aligned
   boxes. prism() turns a solid about a pivot and tapers one end away, so a
   fold, a curved spout, a barley twist and a drawn glass point are all
   drawable; and quad() takes a colour per corner, so a face can ramp instead
   of sitting flat. A folded sheet of paper, a glazed pot and a rod of blown
   glass are all read from the way light runs across a curve or a crease —
   which is a gradient — so that is where the material lives. */

/* A part's own colour, lit at one end of an axis and shaded at the other:
   the ramp that makes a face read as a surface rather than a painted plane.
   Two multipliers rather than two hexes, so a highlight always belongs to
   the part it highlights and a palette edit carries through every face. */

     head with a beak drawn to a single point, and the tail fans up and back
     where a stock would be. Blush washi outside, indigo on the reverse of
     every fold, gold leaf along the cut edges.

     Nothing here is a box. Paper has no flat colour — it has a bright edge
     at the fold and a dark one in the valley, which is why every panel
     carries a ramp rather than a tint; that ramp is the entire difference
     between folded paper and a pink brick.

     Compact and magazine-forward survives intact: the crane's folded keel
     hangs forward and low, raked ahead of the trigger hand, exactly where a
     magazine reads from across a street. */

     poured spout that lifts and flares to a gold-rimmed lip, and the stock
     is the pot's handle — a real open loop you can see the street through.

     Glaze is the whole material argument. A curved glazed surface is dark
     where it turns away and bright along the shoulder, so every part of the
     pot ramps from one to the other; the taper supplies the curve and the
     ramp supplies the glaze, and neither alone would read as porcelain.

  /* TWISTED GLASS CANE — a Victorian glass friendship cane, drawn out on a
     rod and twisted while it was still soft. The whole gun is one shaft: six
     segments, each rolled a third of a turn past the one behind it, so the
     inked corners wind down the length as a barley twist and an aqua ribbon
     spirals through the berry glass with them. It ends in a collar turned on
     the diagonal and a tip drawn to a point; a gathered gob of glass hangs
     under the middle with the drip still on it, and the stock is the cane's
     crook — back, up, over and down again.

     A twist is the one thing an axis-aligned box could not fake at any block
     count, and it is what makes this glass rather than a purple tube. The
     glass tones stay deep on purpose: a pale rod is the failure the pale
     surfaces of this town punish, and berry is what survives being seen
     against a cream porch.

     Long and lean under a raised sight line, exactly as before: the sight is
     a glass rail on two pillars, with a diamond blade up front and a notch at
     the back, and you look along it. */
