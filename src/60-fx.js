   POINT SPRITES

   Our own shader rather than PointsMaterial, for two reasons — and the
   first cut of the shot effects walked into both of them at once.

   IT FADES ON ALPHA, NOT ON BRIGHTNESS. PointsMaterial has no per-particle
   opacity, so the only dimmer available was the vertex colour, and
   multiplying a colour toward zero is a fade only where the blend is
   additive. On the normal-blended pool it is a darkening: the butter
   0xfff1a6 at 55% brightness is 0x8c845b, which is mud. Every confetti
   flake spent the back 70% of its life sliding down to brown, and that —
   not the palette, which was pastel all along — is what put muddy tan
   stars on screen. Alpha fades to nothing under either blend, so both
   pools now use it, and the near-lens fade above can apply to both instead
   of only to the additive one.

   IT CANNOT GROW PAST FX_SPRITE_MAX_H. gl_PointSize goes as 1/distance
   with nothing to stop it: the 0.16m confetti sprite is 12px across a wall
   six metres off and 1200px across if it spawns six centimetres from the
   eye, which is where a muzzle puff spawns. The clamp is a hard ceiling
   measured in viewport heights, and it binds on the default kill confetti
   exactly as it binds on a bought effect.
   ===================================================================== */

/* No sprite, bought or default, may be wider than a twelfth of the
   viewport height — 75px on a 900px-tall view, half the width of the

   THE POOLS

   Four of them, and the reason there are four rather than two is the
   second failure this file has had: the first cut of the shot effects was
   too big to be fair, the correction was too faint to be worth money, and
   what makes an effect both is not its size — it is its silhouette, its
   blend and which way it falls. Those three live on the pool, not on the
   particle, because gl_PointSize sprites take their texture and their
   blend from one material.

   BLENDING IS THE WHOLE OF WHY BUBBLE TRAIL WAS INVISIBLE. Additive
   blending adds the particle's light to the wall behind it. This town's
   walls are pastel — perimeter 0xdcd3e8, cream 0xfff8f0 — so they are
   already close to the top of the range, and adding a mint or a pale sky
   to them clips every channel to white. The pixel an additive near-white
   particle leaves on a pale lilac wall is exactly the pixel the default's
   white hit-ring leaves there, whatever colour the particle claimed to
   be: the effect could have been magenta and the wall would have gone the
   same white. That is not a dim effect, it is no effect, and effects.test.js
   now measures it.

   So the two pools a bought effect draws into are NORMAL-blended, where
   the particle's colour replaces the wall's instead of being swallowed by
   it, and a deep saturated aqua stays a deep saturated aqua on cream. The
   additive spark pool stays exactly as it was for the things it was always
   for — dart glints, the kill burst, spawn puffs — which are drawn against
   the sky and against each other rather than flat on a wall.

   `grav` is metres per second per second taken off vertical speed, so a

   up on its own, which is the read that survives being seen across the
   map. `knee` is the fraction of a particle's life it spends fading: 0.7
   is a long dissolve, and bead's 0.22 holds a bubble at full strength and
   then takes it away, which is a pop.

/* =====================================================================
   SHOT EFFECTS — the third cosmetic

   One purchase themes a player's whole shooting signature: the wake a shot
   leaves behind it, the colour of the muzzle flash, and the flourish on the
   impact, as one identity. Unlike a viewmodel, every one of those three is
   seen by the other eight people in the room, which is the point.

   Nothing below is a second particle system. Every effect emits into the
   pools above — FX.conf, FX.star, FX.bead — which are fixed in
   size, recycle their oldest slot and allocate nothing per shot. An effect
   is a table of numbers naming which of them to use and how.

   Four rules run through it, and each is a way this can turn into a
   gameplay change wearing a cosmetic's clothes.

   THE OWNER STAYS READABLE. A remote player's shot is drawn in their jersey
   trim -- 70-game.js and 75-network.js both pass that colour in -- and in a
   nine-player match that colour is how you tell who is shooting at you. So
   the effect owns the SHAPE, the MOTION and the hue family of its wake, and
   the owner owns its TINT: every particle is the effect's colour mixed half
   way to the shooter's (FX_TRIM_MIX). A blue jersey's Starfall is a cool
   ice-gold and a pink one's is warm coral-gold, they are still told apart at
   a glance, and both are still obviously Starfall and not Bubble Trail. The
   colour argument used to be handed to fxTracer and dropped on the floor,
   because the projectile meshes carry their own shaders; the wake is what
   finally puts it on screen.

   NO EXTRA INFORMATION. The wake lies along the segment the default
   projectile already flies, from the same muzzle to the same endpoint, and
   every particle dies inside the flight time it decorates. It tells a
   watcher nothing the default did not already tell them -- not where the
   shooter is, not where the shot landed, not a fraction of a second sooner.

   NO EXTRA SCREEN, AND IT IS MEASURED. An effect that blankets your own
   view while you fire is a bought disadvantage; one that blankets an
   opponent's view when your shots land near them is a bought advantage.
   Neither is acceptable, so the budget is not "small and few" but a number:
   EVERY EFFECT COVERS NO MORE OF THE SCREEN THAN THE DEFAULT HIT DOES.
   Effects are told apart by shape, colour, motion and decay -- never by
   size, because size is the one axis that is also a gameplay change.

   AND NO LESS SCREEN THAN NOTHING AT ALL, WHICH IS ALSO MEASURED. The
   round that put that ceiling in place shipped two effects that cleared it
   by drawing nothing anybody could see: Bubble Trail was a faint white
   smudge and Starfall was one pale star. A ceiling with no floor under it
   means the safest possible art passes every test, and the safest possible
   art is not worth money. So the same yardstick now binds from below: an
   effect's carrying colour must change the pixel it covers by AT LEAST A
   THIRD of what the default's own white hit-ring changes it by, measured on
   this town's pale lilac wall, after the shooter's jersey has been mixed
   into it. Two of an effect's colours have to clear that, so no effect can
   rest on one lucky hue.

   The axis is contrast against a pale surface, and it has to be, because
   the thing that has now sunk five cosmetics in this project is a colour
   washing toward white. Chroma cannot see that failure: 0xb8f2d8 has plenty
   of chroma and is invisible on cream. Only compositing the particle over
   the wall it is actually drawn on can, which is what the floor does.

   The yardstick, and the arithmetic behind the numbers on each effect
   below. A 1600x900 viewport, the camera's 74-degree vertical field, a
   wall six metres off -- 99.5 pixels to the metre. A point sprite of world
   size s is s * 450 / 6 pixels wide there, so the 0.16m confetti sprite is
   12px, the 0.17m star 12.8px and the 0.20m bubble 15px. Areas are the
   whole sprite quad, which is deliberately pessimistic: the candy sparkle
   inks 23% of its quad, the needle star about 12% and the bubble, which is
   a rim around a hole, about 35%.

     DEFAULT (a BUBBLEGUN pellet on a wall)   7900 px^2
       hit-ring, peak radius 1.01m, annulus   7200
       nine droplets                           690

     fx-starfall    17 sprites x 163          2770 px^2   0.35x default
     fx-confettipop 20 sprites x 144          2880 px^2   0.36x default
     fx-bubbletrail 11 sprites x 225          2480 px^2   0.31x default

   Bubble Trail went DOWN, from 0.73x. The bloom of additive sugar grains
   it used to leave on the wall is gone rather than retuned: at 20% opacity
   added to a pastel wall it was drawing nothing, and a mechanism that
   draws nothing is not a small effect, it is a bug that costs frames. The
   soft 0.30m blob it used to ride went with it. What replaced both is
   colour and blend, which cost no pixels at all.

   Both distances and both sizes scale as 1/d, so those ratios hold at
   every range -- with one exception, which is where the first cut of this
   went wrong. A point sprite six centimetres from the eye is 1200px across
   and the default draws nothing there at all. Three things close that:
   FX_SPRITE_MAX_H clamps any sprite to a twelfth of the viewport height,
   FX_EFFECT_STANDOFF starts the wake and the flash a metre down the
   barrel, and FX_EFFECT_CLEAR forbids an effect particle inside 0.9m of
   the lens outright. effects.test.js checks all of it.

   And no effect touches the muzzle light's intensity or range -- only its
   hue -- nor draws a ring: an expanding ring is the default impact's own
   silhouette, and it is both the largest thing on the frame and the one
   shape a bought effect has no business echoing.

   NO EXTRA COST. Counts are per shot, halve under SOFTWARE_GPU, and are
   bounded whatever the range: a 90m rifle shot lays down the same five
   particles a 6m one does. Nine players on automatics is roughly 110 shots
   a second; that is at most seventeen particles a shot spread across pools
   of 900, 420 and 360, each of which recycles its oldest slot and allocates
   nothing. The two pools added for silhouette are the small ones, and they
   are two more draw calls of nothing when nobody in the room owns them.

/* Half. Far enough that the effect keeps a recognisable colour of its own,

   A shot starts at the shooter's eye, so for the one player whose eye the
   camera is at, a muzzle particle spawned 6cm along it is a particle on the
   lens: 1200 pixels of it, six at a time, every time they pull the trigger.
   FX_SPRITE_MAX_H stops it filling the frame and nearFade stops it being
   opaque, but neither makes it a good idea — the default draws nothing in
   the first metre of a shot, and a metre down the barrel is also where a
   muzzle flash looks like it comes from. */
const FX_EFFECT_STANDOFF = 1.1;
/* And the floor under it. Whatever the geometry -- a shot fired into a wall
   you are standing against, somebody firing point blank into your face --
   nothing an effect draws is allowed inside this radius of the lens. It is
   also where both pools hit the sprite clamp, so this is the distance at
   which every number in the budget above stops being able to grow. */

/* Every colour below belongs to a hue this town is already painted in --
   the coral of the roofs and the truck, the sky of the south house and the
   glass, the violet of the periwinkle roof and the perimeter wall. What has
   changed since the last round is the VALUE they are taken at.

   Confetti Pop's palette is the town's own pastels and it is the one that
   landed on screen, because being seven hues at once is a signal that
   survives being pale. The other two are one hue each, and one pale hue on
   a pale wall is nothing. So Starfall's amethyst and Bubble Trail's aqua
   are taken two or three steps down the value ramp -- the same colours a
   little deeper, occupying exactly the same pixels. A saturated colour is
   not a bigger effect, it is a visible one, and it costs the match nothing.

   Nothing here is near-white and nothing is neon: the deepest value below
   sits at luma 0.49, well clear of the town's ink at 0.27 and of its tyre
   grey at 0.52, and nothing exceeds the chroma of the roofs. Three hue
   families, three silhouettes, three directions -- AMETHYST needles that

     wall and comes back down while you are still looking at it. Amethyst,
     the one cool violet in the town, worn by nothing else. 17 sprites,

     dissolve. Sea-glass aqua through sky: deep enough to sit on a cream
     wall, which the mint and the near-white it used to wear were not.
     11 sprites, 2480 px^2, 0.31x the default hit — DOWN from 0.73x.

     This is the one the round is about. It was drawn additively in three
     near-whites, which on a pastel wall is the same pixel the default
     already draws there and no pixel at all anywhere else. Normal blending
     and three colours two steps deeper take its carrying contrast from
     0.000 to 0.084, on a footprint that shrank by more than half. */

   THE EFFECT IN THE DISPLAY CASE

   A character and a gun can be handed to the store as a model, because
   that is what they are. An effect is motion, and the pools it draws from
   live in the world scene and are driven by somebody pulling a trigger —
   neither of which the store has. So it previews as its own small loop:
   one shot crossing the case, laying its wake, and popping at the far
   end, over and over, in the same colours, the same directions and the
   same lifetimes the real thing uses.

   It is deliberately a handful of plain meshes rather than a second copy
   of the emitters above. Nothing here runs during a match; it exists only
   while the panel is open, and 82-store.js stops it the moment it closes.

   `null` is the default look and previews as a bare shot with no wake,
   which is what makes the case's default-versus-selection comparison mean
   something for this cosmetic too.
